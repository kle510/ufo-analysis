The person was driving in the vicinity of the Cordova Airport, when the witness reports observing a &quot;clump of fog&quot; jumping across the roadway in front of the car.  The witness&apos;s attention is immediately drawn to the event, although concludes that it must just have been fog being swept over the roadway.  A few seconds later, witness sees the same event, but the &quot;object&quot; is now closer, and more visible.  The circling event occurs a total of six times, and is concluded when a strange looking object is hovering over the right-front fender of the witness&apos;s car.  The witness proceeds to drive many more miles toward the town of Cordova, when the witness becomes aware of two large, disc-shaped objects sitting in a meadow beside the roadway.  The witness calls the next morning, and is quite emotionally upset by the experience.  Reports that the event was quite dramatic.", "airport_name": "Fairbanks International Airport", "airport_distance": 286.36452157334173, "closest_shooting": 1108.2477945146784, "shootings_in_state": 1, "shootings_per_year": 5, "closest_hospital_name": "Mat-Su VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic", "closest_hospital_distance": 256.3326886385289, "closest_hospital_region": "VISN 20: Northwest Network", "average_sentiment": -0.4105960264900662, "average_sentiment_confidence": 0.8938002483443711, "most_popular_airline": "United"}
