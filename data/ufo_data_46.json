Craft were seen to streak overhead, as well as to descend vertically, as fast as a meteorite, then stop suddenly just above the ground.  During the last 30 minutes of the sighting, aircraft, which appeared to be U. S. military craft, were seen either pursuing, or chaperoning, the strange craft.. Objects were cone-shaped, with a red nose and a green tail (sic).", "airport_name": "General Mitchell International Airport", "airport_distance": 6.015689945344303, "closest_shooting": 4.54723145345627, "shootings_in_state": 12, "shootings_per_year": 5, "closest_hospital_name": "Mound Cemetery Soldiers' Lot", "closest_hospital_distance": 4.340643750576731, "closest_hospital_region": "Midwest District", "average_sentiment": -0.43004115226337447, "average_sentiment_confidence": 0.8983115226337443, "most_popular_airline": "United"}
