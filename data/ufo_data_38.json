They had turned from Route 441 to Route 411 and had driven south approximately 3 miles, when they observed a huge triangular ship, estimated to be 50 yds. in width, hovering less than 100 yds. off the ground.  It was virtually motionless in the sky, except when it was to seen to rotate horizontally.  It had a red and blue light on the ventral side, and there were either 3 or 4 strange lights on what was taken to be the trailing edge of the craft.  Observed for 2 or 3 minutes.  The observers were awed by what they had seen.  They said it was very similar to the triangular craft reported over Belgium, which they had seen described on television.", "airport_name": "McGhee Tyson Airport", "airport_distance": 15.032930897051212, "closest_shooting": 19.66423022729996, "shootings_in_state": 8, "shootings_per_year": 5, "closest_hospital_name": "Knoxville Vet Center", "closest_hospital_distance": 7.896408104867436, "closest_hospital_region": "VISN 9: VA MidSouth Healthcare Network", "average_sentiment": -0.4409722222222222, "average_sentiment_confidence": 0.8949989850427333, "most_popular_airline": "US Airways"}
