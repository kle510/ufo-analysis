She looked out her kitchen window, and saw an exceptionally bright green light, which she thought was the landing light on a local logging helicopter.  Then she noticed there was a &quot;wavy, lavender-red thing&quot; behind the light.  It hovered in the night sky for an hour, moving perceptibly across the sky.  One hour after she first observed the object, a smaller &quot;dot&quot; of light streaked up to the larger object.  A third object then became visible, and then all three faded from sight.
